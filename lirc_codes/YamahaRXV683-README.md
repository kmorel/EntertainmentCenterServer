These codes were constructed by taking the codes in YamahaRXV685.pdf taken
from

https://www.snapav.com/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/attachments/documents/Amplifiers/SupportDocuments/Extended_IR_Codes_RX-V685RX-A780-RX-A3080CX-A5200_6.pdf

This spreadsheet contains what Yamaha calls "NEC IR" codes. To convert them
to pronto codes, you can use this web page:

For some reason, the referenced pdf does not have the codes for volume
up or volume down. However, I found some codes on someone else's smart
remote project on GitHub:

https://github.com/Gronis/yamaha-ir-codes/blob/master/yamaha_rxv.csv

They list VOLUME+ as 7A-1A and VOLUME- as 7A-1B.

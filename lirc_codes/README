This directory is a collection of IR codes that eventually go to an LIRC
configure file. The assumption is that most of the codes originate from
a pronto code posted on the internet and are eventually converted to LIRC
hex codes. To do that, make a text file named <device>.pronto with each
line of the form <code name>:<pronto code>. Then run the pronto2hex script,
which uses pronto2lirc.py and irrecord to convert to a LIRC configuration
file named <device>.lircd.conf.

Once you have codes for all the devices you want to support, cat them
together into a file called lircd.conf and copy them to the /etc/lirc
directory. (You may want to save the original file there.)
